### DESCRIPTION
   A Machine learning application to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes.

## MOTIVATION
- Diabetes is one of the most common chronic health conditions faced by the world, specially western countries. 
- Having insights and developping applications on diabetes data can help many patients to combat the desease.   
- To contribute on sharing knowledge to the data science community. 
  

## DATA SOURCE
The data is source is here [UCI-Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

## DEPLOYMENT
#### This application is deployed to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com).
#### You can access the application [here](https://diabeteprediction.herokuapp.com/).
#### Note: Making a query may take few secondes to load the data sometimes, as the server may be in hibernate state.

## How to use
- In the application interface, type only positive values.

- Once you type the convenient values, click on the submit botton to get the result of the prediction.

## Usage
You can use this project for further developing it and adding your work in it. If you use this project, kindly mention the original source of the project and mention the link of this repo in your report.

## Further Improvements
There are somethings to improve upon

- CSS style is not in the CSS folder instead I have included the style in the html code. When I included the CSS in the CSS folder, it was not having effect on the application interface, I have faced this issue on many other projects :cry:
- One can include a deep learning model in the model selection as one of the candidate.
- The application can be modularized.
